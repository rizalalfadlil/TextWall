## Known Issues
### Issues
|id|details|
|---|---|
|`P1`|Wallpaper Eventually changed to default (I Don't Know The cause, is this caused by the App or the Device itself)|
|`P2`|Accessibility settings permission reset after clicking restart button inside the app on some phone (won't reset if the app is restarted manually)|
|`P3`|Enable/Disable wallpaper button state doesn't changed instantly (the function still worked, but to show current state requiring restart)
